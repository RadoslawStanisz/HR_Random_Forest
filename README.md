### Project overview

The goal of this project is to develop a supervised machine learning model - random forest - that predicts whether an employee leaves the company.
In addition, unsupervised model - K-means clustering - is performed to further explore the dataset.

### Project structure

1. Exploratory data analysis --> `EDA` notebook
2. Feature engineering & random forest model building --> `Modeling` notebook
3. Clustering using K-means algorithm - `Clustering` notebook

The notebooks use the functions included in helper_functions.py module

### Dataset

This is a capstone project of Google Advanced Data Analytics specialization

### Tools

- EDA: Pandas
- Building models: Scikit learn
- Data visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
